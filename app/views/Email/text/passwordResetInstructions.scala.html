Forgot your password, @user.getUsername?

Skyjam received a request to reset the password for your account (@user.getUsername).

To reset your password, click on the link below (or copy and paste the URL into your browser):

@routes.UserController.resetPassword(upr.getCode).absoluteURL(play.mvc.Http.Context.current().request(), global.Global.isSecure())

If you're getting a lot of password reset emails you didn't request, you can change your account settings to require personal information to start a password reset.
